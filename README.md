# BartFitness

This is my personal fitness page that features an about me section describing a bit about me and what kind of services I offer. The website also features a programs section which tells user what kind of program pakage they can opt into and by clicking learn more, the website brings users to its own page describing the programs in more detail. Users can also contact me by filling out a form with their details and a message which they can then submit and the message with their details will be sent to my personal email.

* BartFitness is a single web application written using ReactJS framework.
* I have used css modules to style individual components.
* The website is responsive and functions both on mobile and desktop devices.
* I have used an emailing service called EmailJs for allowing users of the website to send a message to the linked email address.
